        This program is in beta. Only a few features have been
        implemented at the moment. For a list of these, see below.
        It's in development, so all the mentioned features will,
        at some point, be added. Email me at j.garby@icloud.com
        for suggestions.

      <p>
        This started as my first Java Swing project, but then I realised that I could
        make an actually useful lightweight Python IDE. In some ways it's similar to
        IDLE (as in, only one file - no tabs, and a way to run the file from the IDE),
        But I came up with a couple of new features which makes this text editor
        very handy.
      </p>

      <h1>Features</h1>
      <h2>Easily changeable settings</h2>
      <img src="images/prefsshot.png" alt="Preferences Screenshot" width="670px"/>
      <p>
        Here's a screenshot of the program after the <em>Settings</em> button is clicked.
        More preferences will be added in the near future, but for now what you
        can change is:
        <ul>
          <li>The command run on press of <em>Run in python.</em></li>
          <li>The tab size to display.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Ability to run a Python script in the command line</h2>
      <img src="images/pyrunshot.png" alt="Running script in Python" width="670px"/>
      <p>
        This feature should be demonstrated enough from the screenshot, but I should
        point out that of course this can be used for more than just text-based
        programs. It will work well with just about any Python program. Note that
        it runs it's scripts in Python 3, but if you'd like to change this, edit
        the command in the preferences (as demonstrated previously).
      </p>
      <h2>Running any command in the command line</h2>
      <img src="images/cmdshot.png" alt="Demonstration of command line" width="670px"/>
      <p>
        This feature is similar to the previously showcased one, but it's different.
        This is because instead of running the current Python file in the command
        line, it will actually execute any command you'd like. This could be used
        for many different purposes, like checking files in a directory; running
        scripts in different languages and even using piping to do some more
        complex commands.
      </p>
      <h2>Syntax highlighting for Python</h2>
      <img src="images/synshot.png" alt="Syntax highlighting" width="670px"/>
      <p>
        For this feature I used a library made by someone else - available
        <a href="https://github.com/bobbylight/RSyntaxTextArea"> here on GitHub</a>.
        The syntax highlighting is automatically applied when any .py file, or
        any .json file, is opened. Python files - because of course it's a Python
        IDE, and JSON files as the preferences are written in this. If you would
        like any other languages to be supported, definitely contact me about it!
