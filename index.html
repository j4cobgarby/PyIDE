        This program is in alpha. Only a few features have been
        implemented at the moment. For a list of these, see below.
        It's in development, so all the mentioned features will,
        at some point, be added. Email me at j.garby@icloud.com
        for suggestions.

        This started as my first Java Swing project, but then I realised that I could
        make an actually useful lightweight Python IDE. In some ways it's similar to
        IDLE (as in, only one file - no tabs, and a way to run the file from the IDE),
        But I came up with a couple of new features which makes this text editor
        very handy.
